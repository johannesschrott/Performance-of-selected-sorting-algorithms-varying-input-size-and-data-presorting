# Performance of selected sorting algorithms varying input size and data presorting
This repository contains the code of the benchmark which we developed for paper in the course "Pr√§sentations- und Arbeitstechnik" at the Johannes Kepler University, Linz.

After cloning the repo to your computer, choose the `target` directory and run the benchmark using `java -jar benchmark-1.0.jar`.
